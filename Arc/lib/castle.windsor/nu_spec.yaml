description: |
  The Castle MicroKernel is an inversion of control container that was designed towards extensibility. It combines facilities to grow orthogonally. These facilities work side-by-side, without interfering or depending on each other, to allow you to easily extend the container functionality by plugging in new concerns and semantics. You can use it as an embeddable container on tools that support extensions or plugin support, such as tools which exposes configurable pipelines or compilers. The container is set up and configured through code, and can be extended to work with a configuration system that your project supports.
  
  Castle Windsor aggregates the MicroKernel and exposes a powerful configuration support. It is suitable for common enterprise application needs. It is able to register facilities and components based on the configuration and adds support for interceptors.
